## Hello friends, I'm Jahir 👋 


### About Me<br>
I am a seasoned freelance data scientist specialising in *data*, *insight* and *predictive analysis*.<br> 

I'm a bimodal sort of guy with only two real interests in life; data 📈 and cycling 🚲.<br>
(too slow to make it as a cyclist so sticking with data)

### My work history
I've been in the data and insights game for over a decade.
